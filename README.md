# Unplann'd

**Unplann’d** is a simple mobile app designed to help you **stay active without a rigid routine**. Instead of scheduled workout times, the app sends you **three random notifications per day**—each one nudging you to do a short workout.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The idea came from a user who wanted more **spontaneity** in their day—something to break up long periods of sitting or working, without having to plan gym sessions or rigid schedules.

---

## ⏰ How It Works

- Every day, between **9:00 AM and 9:00 PM**, the app sends **three notifications** at random times.
- Each notification prompts you to do one of the following exercises:
  - **🧱 Plank**
  - **🕴️ Jumping Jacks**
  - **💪 Push-ups**
