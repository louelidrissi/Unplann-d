# Unplann'd

**Unplann’d** is a simple mobile app designed to help you **stay active without a rigid routine**. Instead of scheduled workout times, the app sends you **three random notifications per day**—each one nudging you to do a short workout.

## 🎯 Purpose

The idea came from a user who wanted more **spontaneity** in their day—something to break up long periods of sitting or working, without having to plan gym sessions or rigid schedules.
