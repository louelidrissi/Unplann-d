# Unplann'd

Unplannâ€™d is a simple mobile app designed to help you stay active without a rigid routine. Instead of scheduled workout times, the app sends you 3 random notifications per day each one nudging you to do a short workout.

## Purpose

Our user request was an app to break up long periods of sitting or working, without having to plan gym sessions or stick to rigid schedule since during his first semester of college.

##  How It Works

- Every day, between 9:00 AM and 9:00 PM, the app sends 3 notifications at random times.
- Per user request, each notification prompts you to do one of the following exercises:
  - Plank
  - Jumping Jacks
  - Push-ups
